# Find and Colearn
**Transforming Solo Study into a Dynamic, Collaborative Experience**

---

## About
Find and Colearn is a collaborative learning platform built by four Computer Science students who believe studying doesn’t have to be lonely. Our mission is simple: make it easier for students to find partners, collaborate in real time, and grow together.

---

## How It Works

1. **Sign Up & Pick a Topic**  
   Select a subject (e.g., Calculus, DSA, Chemistry) and hit "Find a Partner."

2. **Discovery Chat**  
   Get five minutes to text or talk and see if you're a good match.

3. **Instant Collaboration Room**  
   If both agree, you're dropped into a shared whiteboard room to sketch, solve, and learn together.

4. **Invite Friends**  
   Want to study with people you know? Create a private room and share a link with up to three friends.
